## About the collection 

This collection provides a broad overview of the published material in the Gertzel Library. 

It shows the subject areas, as well as the quantity and types, of published material in the Library. 

The aim is to make information about the collection more readily available in order to find suitable homes for the material so that they can be accessed by Africanist scholars and researchers. 

## Items in the collection 

There are two types of 'items': 
1. visual descriptions (170 images) of the monographs (each photo shows between 20-30 book titles). 
2. text descriptions (94 entries) of the published periodicals, reports and research papers (each entry represents a 50l box of materials).   
 
#### Monographs: 
There are 170 images of monographs, rerpresenting approximately 4000 titles.  The majority of the books are about Africa and have been categorised either according to country (69 items) or subject area (54 items).  The remaining 47 items are of other more general topics such as third world development and political theory.

#### Periodicals: 
There are 26 boxes holding around 150 periodical titles.  Approximately 135 of these titles are not available electronically. There are some large runs, such as the Kenua Weekly Review (a complete set from 1970s - 1990s) as well as hard to obtain titles that date back to the 1950s.
