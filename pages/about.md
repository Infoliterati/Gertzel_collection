## About the collection 

This collection provides a broad overview of the published material in the Gertzel Library. 

It shows the subject areas, as well as the quantity and types, of published material in the Library. 

The purpose of the collection is to make information about it more readily available in order to find a suitable home (or homes) for the material so that they can be used by Africanist scholars and researchers. 

## Items in the collection 

There are two types of 'items': 
1. visual descriptions (170 images) of the monographs (each photo shows between 20-30 book titles). 
2. text descriptions (94 entries) of the published periodicals, reports and research papers (each entry represents a 50l box of materials). 

More detailed descriptions follow:
